Hi Akshaya,

Thanks for the update!

    1) I have taken a look at the repository you have created and kind of understood what goes where.

 
Excellent. Please feel free to re-structure things when necessary.
 

    2) I have annotated and saved 30 scenes as we agreed, but they are still in the XML format, yet to be converted to JSON


Sounds good! I am really curios to see the new annotations. 


    3) I have actually been working on the next goal which is to get all scenes annotated, I have been talking to my university here and they have requested me to present them with a talk and have a student interaction before I can hire the students. (Bureaucracy is slightly lethargic here!)


OK, but at least its clear what to do, to get their support.
 


    4) I checked out the different python libraries to write into JSON files from a data structure, it would be nice if you could tell me which one you are using.


The library I was using is called 'json'. In python you've just to put the 'import json' directive in the beginning of the file. The API is quite simple:

1) Loading the scenes in JSON data structure from a file: 

with open(args[0]) as in_file:
           scenes = json.load(in_file)

2) Saving the data:

with open(args[1],'w') as out_file:
     out_file.write(json.dumps(conv, out_file, indent=2))

where 'conv' is a JSON data structure.


    5) I have not found a nice way to convert the XML files to data in python, yet - I am looking.


You can also have a look into the converter I wrote if it helps:

    6) I have to give this talk to my university here tomorrow afternoon - it collides with our meeting time, so we should reschedule. Please let me know when is good for you next. We can even discuss after the WP4 meeting or otherwise.


Sure, no problem. Lets do it after the WP4 meeting then. 
 


    7) What has happened at your end? Have you written any scripts to reformat the JSON files? I did not see it on the QSR repo, do let me know.


Yes, indeed. I did the script the week after you left. The script is here:
https://github.com/strands-project/strands_morse/blob/master/src/strand_morse/scene_converter.py

And the resulting scenes are here:
https://github.com/strands-project/strands_qsr/blob/master/data/simulation/bham_office_desk_500.json

Maybe you can also add your 30 scenes in the 'data' directory, in a subfolder 'real-world' once they are converted into JSON. The MORSE scenes are in 'simulation'. 

cheers,
Lars
